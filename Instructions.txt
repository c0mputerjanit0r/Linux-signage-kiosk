Instructions
************

The following steps outline how to image a low-spec microcomputer or AIO device with Rocky Linux and run a shell script to create a login daemon which will open a kiosked instance of Mozilla Firefox to display a signage slideshow created separately with the owl-carousel js plugin and hosted on a separate webserver.

*WARNING*

After building the base image of Rocky Linux, running the shell script will create the login daemon and render the OS inaccesible. If you plan to modify the underlying script and test for your use case, it is best to first build the image in a hypervisor (Hyper-V was used in this project) so changes can quickly be reverted if the script doesn't yield desirable results.

For questions, don't hesitate to contact the author via GitHub.

1.) Download the latest distribution of Rocky Linux for your hardware at https://rockylinux.org/download/. Image a flash drive or other removable media using an imaging tool of your choice (ex. BalenaEtcher or Rufus).
2.) Setup your hardware with Rocky Linux and complete the initial device set up.
3.) Update your image with sudo dnf update -y or via the Software app.
4.) Download the kiosk script from the GitHub project and save it in the /home directory of the user account.
5.) Open the script with Text Editor and update the [YOUR URL HERE] line with the URL of your signage website. Save and close the script.
6.) Open a Terminal instance in the /home directory.
7.) Allow running of the script by root via the command: ```sudo chmod -R 777 .```
8.) Run the kiosk scrtip via the command: ```sudo ./kiosk.sh```
9.) After the script has completed, reboot the machine.

At this point the machine should reboot and upon reboot launch straight into the firefox kiosk instance with your signage site. Sit back and enjoy.
