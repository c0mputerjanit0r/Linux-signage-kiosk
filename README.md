# Linux-signage-kiosk
This repo can be used to generate a lightweight digital signage kiosk by leveraging Rocky Linux, Mozilla Firefox, and a shell script.
# Inspiration
The origin of this project came from the need to develop a lightweight, rapidly deployable signage solution which displays a webpage containing an embedded owl-carousel slideshow. The original code for this project was borrowed from Michael Niehaus. Check out his blog, Out of Office Hours over at:
