# Linux-signage-kiosk
This repo can be used to generate a lightweight digital signage kiosk by leveraging Rocky Linux, Mozilla Firefox, and a shell script.
# Inspiration
The origin of this project came from the need to develop a lightweight, rapidly deployable signage solution which displays a webpage containing an embedded owl-carousel slideshow. The original code for this project was borrowed from Michael Niehaus. Check out his blog, Out of Office Hours over at:

# Dependencies
For this solution to work, you will need to begin with the latest distribution of Rocky Linux. Download the DVD image for your applicable hardware via:

This solution will also require access to a webserver to host the required Owl Carousel slide show which will be the container for our signage slides. More information on Owl Carousel can be found at the developer's website:
